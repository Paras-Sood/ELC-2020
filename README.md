VR Model made with the motive of overcoming the fear of dark, being stuck in a maze, ghosts......<br><br>
This is the Unity Virtual Reality project made to overcome the "Fear of Darkness". <br>
In this project, the person wearing the cardboard, will move through the fearful streets filled with fear of moving bloodless zombies, fleshy bones and many more fearful elements and in the end if the person gets the right path to move out of this fearful maze, he will see the sky turning bright with positive vibes of a shining star.
